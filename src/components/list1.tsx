                <li>It displays some of the strongest feelings of love and affection</li>
                <li>Even though it may be written with a certain purpose, many of them can be interpreted to benefit the specific reader</li>
                <li>It deals with all sorts of things, from aging (Burdah, Chapter 2) to love (Burdah, Chapter 1).</li>
                <li>Being emotional is corny now, but none of that stigma is shown in Arabic poetry</li>
                <li>It can hype you up, and it can break you down.</li>
            </ul>
